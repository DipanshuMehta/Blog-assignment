      Standing on the stage for the twenty-fifth anniversary of The Princess
      Bride, I felt an almost overwhelming sense of gratitude and nostalgia. It
      was a remarkable night and it brought back vivid memories of being part of

      princesses, giants and jesters, cliffs of insanity, and of course rodents
      of unusual size.

      In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a
      story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was
      a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As
      Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced
      lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of
      intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move and
      weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family.
